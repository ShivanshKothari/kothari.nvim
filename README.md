## My Neovim Config
This is my neovim config after many improvements. The latest improvements include:-
- Treesitter windows compatibility using Zig compiler for compiling parsers
- Modular configuration according to Lazy.nvim file convention
- Fast load with only essential plugins

### Plugins
- Lazy package manager (Great for fast plugin install and configuration)
- Catppuccin theme (IDK, just seems comfortable to the eyes ╰(*°▽°*)╯)
- Treesitter (Duh)
- Telescope (Probably the best for fuzzy finding files, live grep, searching git files etc.)
- Mason, mason-lspconfig, nvim-lspconfig (Great LSP support from install to config to community. Can't go YOLO here :) )
- Lualine (Dracula theme)
- Neotree (File explorer)
- Comment.nvim (Takes the load off commenting different languages in a flash)

### Future improvements
- Adding solution for accessing hidden files and folders especially those following Next.js convention such as route groups
